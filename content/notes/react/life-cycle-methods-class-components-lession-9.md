# Introduction

Life cycle methods are special methods in React class-based components that allow you to run code at specific points in a component's life cycle. These methods offer hooks for managing setup, updates, and teardown of your components. The life cycle of a class-based component can be divided into three main phases:

1. Mounting
2. Updating
3. Unmounting

Each phase has its unique set of lifecycle methods that React calls during the component's lifecycle.

## Mounting

The Mounting phase is the initial phase in the lifecycle of a React component. It includes the following key lifecycle methods:

1. Constructor
2. render
3. getDerivedStateFromProps
4. componentDidMount

Let's explore each of these methods with practical examples to understand their usage and benefits.
