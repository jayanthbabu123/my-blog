### Beginner - Answer 1️⃣

In CSS, the Universal Selector, denoted as `*`, is a selector that targets every element on a webpage. When you apply styles using `*`, these styles are applied universally to all elements. For example, writing `* { color: red; }` in CSS would change the text color to red for every element on the page. It is a straightforward way to apply a common style across all elements.

### Intermediate - Answer 2️⃣

The Universal Selector `*` in CSS is a comprehensive selector that affects every element within an HTML document. It is commonly used for applying a uniform style to all elements or setting foundational styles. For instance, `* { margin: 0; padding: 0; }` is a typical usage that resets margins and paddings of all elements, establishing a consistent baseline for further detailed styling. However, it should be used with consideration due to potential performance impacts and the possibility of overriding more specific styles.

### Advanced - Answer 3️⃣

The Universal Selector `*` in CSS is an inclusive selector that matches every element in a document's HTML structure. It is often utilized for implementing global style resets or universal adjustments to the box model, such as `* { box-sizing: border-box; }`. While it is a powerful tool, its usage requires caution due to the potential for performance issues and unintentional style conflicts. In complex and large-scale web applications, its use is typically carefully evaluated, with a preference for more specific and efficient selectors to ensure optimal performance and maintainability.
