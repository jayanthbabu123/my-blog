In HTML, elements are categorized into two main display types: `block-level elements` and `inline elements`. These display types determine how the elements are rendered on a web page and how they interact with other elements.

### Block-level elements üß±

- Block-level elements typically start on a new line and occupy the full width available within their parent container. They create a "block" or rectangular box in the layout. Common block-level elements include `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`.

- Block-level elements can contain other block-level elements and inline elements. They can also be nested within other block-level elements.

- Being block-level, these elements can have `width`, `height`, `margin`, and `padding` specified, which will be respected by the layout engine.

- These elements are primarily used for structuring and laying out larger sections of a page. For instance, a `<div>` can be used to group a section of text, while `<p>` separates paragraphs.

### Inline elements ‚úèÔ∏è

- Inline elements do not start on a new line and only occupy the space necessary for their content. They appear next to each other horizontally within the same line.. The common inline elements include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<input>`, and `<label>`.

- Inline elements cannot contain block-level elements but can contain other inline elements.

- Setting `width` and `height` on inline elements doesn't have any effect. `Margins` are applied only horizontally (left and right) but not vertically (top and bottom).

- These elements are primarily used for formatting and styling text. For instance, `<a>` and `<img>` are used to create links and images, respectively.

One practical example to illustrate this is when I'm coding a webpage. If I want to create a header, I use a block-level element like `<header>` to ensure it takes the full width and stands apart from the rest of the content. But within that header, if I want to include a navigation link, I'll use an inline element like `<a>` so it can sit within a sentence or alongside other links without breaking the flow.

## Key Point üñãÔ∏è

In modern web development, these behaviors can be altered using CSS (e.g., using `display: block`, `display: inline`, `display: inline-block`), but understanding their default behaviors is important for writing semantic HTML.
