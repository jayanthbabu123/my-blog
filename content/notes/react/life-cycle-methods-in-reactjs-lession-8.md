# Introduction

Lifecycle methods, within the context of React components, are special functions that execute at specific moments in a component's lifetime. They provide developers with the ability to manage a component's behavior when it's initially created (mounted), updated, and removed (unmounted) from the DOM.

**Phases of the React Component Lifecycle**

A React component undergoes three major phases:

1. Mounting: Occurs when a component is first created and inserted into the DOM.
2. Updating: Occurs when changes to a component's props or state trigger a re-render.
3. Unmounting: Occurs when a component is removed from the DOM.

## Writing Life Cycle Methods:

In functional components, we can use React hooks to replicate the behavior of class-based life cycle methods. The useEffect hook is particularly useful for defining life cycle behavior in functional components.

Below are the commonly used life cycle methods in functional components along with their equivalents using the useEffect hook:
