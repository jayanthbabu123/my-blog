### Beginner - Answer 1️⃣

Selectors in CSS are tools used to identify and apply styles to HTML elements on a webpage. They come in different types:

1. **Type Selectors:** Select elements by their HTML tag, like `h1` for headers.
2. **Class Selectors:** Use the class attribute of elements, like `.menu`.
3. **ID Selectors:** Select unique elements using their ID attribute, like `#footer`.
4. **Attribute Selectors:** Choose elements based on their attributes, like `[type='text']`.
5. **Pseudo-class Selectors:** Target elements in specific states, such as :hover.
6. **Pseudo-element Selectors:** Style certain parts of elements, like `::first-letter`.

The priority, or specificity, of these selectors varies: ID selectors have the highest priority, followed by class selectors, pseudo-class and attribute selectors, and then type selectors.

### Intermediate - Answer 2️⃣

Selectors in CSS are used to identify and apply styles to specific HTML elements. Different types of selectors have varying levels of specificity:

1. **Type Selectors**: Target elements by their tag name, e.g., `p` for paragraphs.
2. **Class Selectors:** Select elements by their class attribute, e.g., `.button`.
3. **ID Selectors:** Identify elements by their unique ID attribute, e.g., `#navbar`.
4. **Attribute Selectors:** Target elements with certain attributes, e.g., `[href='#']`.
5. **Pseudo-classes:** Style elements in particular states, like `:focus`.
6. **Pseudo-elements:** Apply styles to parts of elements, e.g., `::after`.

The specificity hierarchy is important in CSS: `ID selectors` are the most specific, followed by `class`, `pseudo-class` and `attribute` selectors, and then `type` selectors. Understanding this order is key to effectively managing styles.

### Advanced - Answer 3️⃣

In CSS, selectors are fundamental for targeting HTML elements to style. They vary in specificity and function:

1. `Type Selectors:` Select elements by tag name, like `body`.
2. `Class Selectors:` Use the class attribute for selection, e.g., `.alert-box`.
3. `ID Selectors:` Target unique elements with an ID attribute, e.g., `#main-content`.
4. `Attribute Selectors:` Choose elements based on specific attributes, e.g., `[type='checkbox']`.
5. `Pseudo-classes:` Select elements in certain states, like `:hover`.
6. `Pseudo-elements:` Style specific parts of elements, such as `::before`.

The specificity hierarchy in CSS dictates which styles prevail in conflicts. ID selectors have the highest specificity, followed by class selectors, pseudo-classes, and attributes, and the least specific are type selectors.
