HTML5, the fifth version of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), introduced several new features and improvements over its previous version, HTML4.

**1. Semantic Elements:** HTML5 introduced elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>`. These provide a clearer structure, making it easier to understand the role of different parts of a webpage. This not only aids in readability but also benefits SEO and accessibility.

**2. Video and Audio Support:** Before HTML5, embedding audio and video in web pages usually required third-party plugins. HTML5 introduced the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, allowing for native media playback. It's akin to having a built-in media player in your web page.

**3. Web Storage:** HTML5 introduced two important storage options: `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. These allow websites to store data on the client's browser in a more secure and efficient way than the older cookies method.

**4. New Form Attributes:** HTML5 introduced new form attributes like `required`, `placeholder`, `disabled`, and `readonly`. These attributes help make forms more accessible and user-friendly.
And also introduced new input type attributes like `date`, `time`, `week`, `month`, `number`, `email`,, `tel`, `color`, and `password`.

**5. New Global Attributes:** HTML5 introduced several new global attributes like `contenteditable`, `spellcheck`, and `data-*` (for custom data attributes). These provide more control and flexibility over the behavior of HTML elements.

**6. Geolocation API:** This allows websites to access the geographical location of the user. Think of how many apps now suggest restaurants or shops near you; that's often powered by this feature.

These new features make HTML5 a more comprehensive and powerful language than HTML4.
