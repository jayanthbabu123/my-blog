## Assignment: Build a Personal Profile Page
`Objective:` Create an HTML document that serves as a personal profile page. This page will include sections for personal information, a biography, educational background, skills, and a contact form. Each section should utilize the HTML elements you've been taught.

## Detailed Instructions:

## Header with Navigation:

- Use `<div>` tags to create a container for the header.
- Inside the header, use `<h1>` for your name.
- Below your name, use `<ul>` to create a navigation menu with `<li>` items. Each item should contain an `<a>` tag - that would hypothetically link to different sections of your profile (e.g., `"#biography"`, `"#education"`, `"#skills"`, `"#contact"`).

## Biography Section:

- Start this section with an `<h2>` tag titled "Biography".
- Include a paragraph `<p>` describing yourself. Within this paragraph, use `<strong>`, `<b>`, and `<i>` to emphasize key words or phrases. Use `<br>` to create line breaks as needed.

## Educational Background:

- Title this section with an `<h2>` tag.
- Use `<ol>` or `<ul>` to list the schools you've attended or courses you've completed. Use `<li>` for each item.

##  Skills Section:

Use an `<h2>` tag for the section title.
List your skills using `<ul>`. Within each `<li>`, you might want to emphasize certain skills using `<strong>` or `<b>`, and describe your proficiency level in a `<span>`.
Gallery Section:

## Title this section with <h2>.
Use `<div>` tags to create a container for your images.
Inside the container, insert several `<img>` tags to display images that are meaningful to you (e.g., hobbies, achievements). Use alt attributes to describe each image.

## Contact Form:


Use `<h2>` for the section title as Contact Form.

The form should include the following elements:
- Name  --> Input type `text`
- Email --> Input type `email`
- Message --> Input type `text`

Create a "Send me a message" button using the `<button>` tag. Since form handling is not covered, the button does not need to perform any action.

## Footer:

Use a `<div>` to create a footer at the bottom of the page.
Inside the footer, include a `<p>` tag with copyright information. Use the `<span>` tag to emphasize the year.
