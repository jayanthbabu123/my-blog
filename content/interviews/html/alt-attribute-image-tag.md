The alt attribute, short for "alternative text," is an important element in HTML used for describing images. Its main role is to provide a backup text description when an image cannot be displayed, due to reasons like network issues or incorrect image paths. This ensures that users still understand what image was meant to be there by seeing a text description.

Moreover, the `alt` text is crucial for improving Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for websites. Search engines use this text to better understand the content of images. Using the `alt` attribute is part of adhering to web standards and best practices, as outlined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

When writing `alt` text, it's important to be concise yet descriptive. The text should convey the same message or purpose as the image. For example, if an image is purely decorative and adds no additional information to the content, it's common to use an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) to indicate this to screen readers.

```html
<!-- Image with descriptive alt text -->
<img src="path-to-image.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset over the mountains" />

<!-- Decorative image with empty alt attribute -->
<img src="decorative-border.jpg" alt="" />
```

In summary, the `alt` attribute is an important element in HTML used for describing images.
