![Async Await Javascript Lession 18](/images/js-async-await.webp)

## Introduction ðŸŒ±
Async/await is a modern syntax in JavaScript that allows you to work with asynchronous operations in a more readable and synchronous manner, Introduced as part of ECMAScript 2017. It's built on top of promises, providing a way to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves a bit more like synchronous code. This is particularly useful when dealing with operations that need to wait for something to happen, such as fetching data from an API, without blocking the execution of subsequent code.
